## PLEASE READ THIS

### I will use this file to relay any updates. So far:

- Added a very simple menu.
- Ability to choose dates if you click on the date at the top screen.
- Added API calls functionality. It will retrieve food data if valid.
- If invalid, i.e. the food is not in the database, users can manually
  enter food.

Currently the database is fully working. It is basically a One-to-Many
database, where one Date in the app can have many food entries.

Now currently working on displaying food info.

### Stuff we have not done yet

- We have not done the Firebase stuff.
- We have not done photo uploading (related to the Firebase funcionality).
