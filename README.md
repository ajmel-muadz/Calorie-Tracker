## PLEASE READ THIS

### I will use this file to relay any updates. So far:

- Added a very simple menu.
- Ability to choose dates if you click on the date at the top screen.
- Added API calls functionality. It will retrieve food data if valid.
- If invalid, i.e. the food is not in the database, users can manually
  enter food.

Currently working on the database functionality. Ideally, we need
to make sure to store food data in the database **first**, then we think
about retrieving data from the database and displaying it. Much easier
that way.

### Stuff we have not done yet

- We have not done the Firebase stuff.
- We have not done photo uploading (related to the Firebase funcionality).
- Have not displayed daily food info. This requires the database to be done.
