## About The Project 

Connect Four Android Game

This project is a feature-rich implementation of the classic Connect Four game for Android. The application is designed to provide an engaging and customizable experience for players while demonstrating key concepts in Android app development, including UI design, event handling, game logic, and modular architecture.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a Connect Four game that supports multiple gameplay modes, personalization options, user profile creation, gameplay statistics tracking, and adaptive UI design. This project showcases a structured approach to software development while adhering to best practices in Android architecture.

Features

1. Multiple Game Modes

Two-Player Mode: Two human players can take turns playing on the same device.

AI Mode: A single player competes against an AI opponent that makes random valid moves.

2. Personalization Options

Grid Size Selection: Players can choose from standard (7x6), small (6x5), or large (8x7) grids.

Custom Player Colors: Users can select their preferred disc colors.

Custom Player Names: Players can enter and use their preferred names in the game.

3. User Profile & Avatars

Players can create a profile with a custom username and avatar.

Profile information is stored locally (data may be lost upon app closure).

4. Gameplay Statistics Tracking

Tracks and displays statistics such as games played, wins, losses, and win percentages.

Statistics are stored temporarily and reset when the app is closed.

5. In-Game Information & Features

Game Board: Displays a clear visual representation of the grid and player moves.

Player Indicators: Shows the current turn and player names.

Move Tracking: Displays the number of moves made and remaining.

Notifications & Messages: Provides messages for important game events (win, draw, invalid move, etc.).

Undo & Reset: Players can undo the last move or reset the board.

Settings & Menu: Access customization settings and navigate through the app.

User Profile Display: Shows player information, including avatars and usernames.

6. Technical Implementation

Adaptive UI: Ensures smooth transitions between landscape and portrait orientations and compatibility across various devices (phones and tablets).

State Preservation: Maintains game state when switching device orientation.

Modular UI Architecture: Separates different UI components (menu, settings, game interface, etc.) for improved maintainability and scalability.

Conclusion

This project serves as an excellent demonstration of Android game development principles, showcasing a balance between user engagement, customization, and software engineering best practices. It is built with modularity in mind, allowing for future enhancements and scalability.
